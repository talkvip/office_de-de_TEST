Sets the priority value for this conditional formatting rule to "1" so that it will be evaluated before all other rules on the worksheet.


## Syntax

 _Ausdruck_ A variable that represents an **AboveAverage** object.


## Remarks

When you have multiple conditional formatting rules in a worksheet, if the rule was not previously set to priority "1", this method will cause the priority of all other existing rules on the worksheet to be increased by one.
