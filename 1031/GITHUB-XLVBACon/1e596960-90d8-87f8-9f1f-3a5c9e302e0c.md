## Remarks


 **Wichtig**  The TRIM function was designed to trim the 7-bit ASCII space character (value 32) from text. In the Unicode character set, there is an additional space character called the nonbreaking space character that has a decimal value of 160. This character is commonly used in Web pages as the HTML entity,  **&amp;nbsp;**. By itself, the TRIM function does not remove this nonbreaking space character.
