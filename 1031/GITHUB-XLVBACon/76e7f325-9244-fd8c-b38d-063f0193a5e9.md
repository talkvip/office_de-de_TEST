Occurs when a new chart is created in the workbook.


## Syntax

 _Ausdruck_ A variable that returns a **[Workbook](8c00aa60-c974-eed3-0812-3c9625eb0d4c.md)** object.


### Parameters

| _Ch_|Erforderlich|**[Chart](179c32ce-49bd-6f36-ea12-89fb5443f3ea.md)**|The new chart.|

### Return Value

Nothing


## Remarks

The  **NewChart** event occurs whenever a new chart is inserted or pasted in a worksheet, a chart sheet, or other sheet types. If multiple charts are inserted or pasted, the event will occur for each chart in the order they are inserted or pasted. If a chart object or chart sheet is moved from one location to another, the event will not occur. However, if the chart is moved between a chart object and a chart sheet, the event will occur because a new chart must be created.

The  **NewChart** event will not occur in the following scenarios: copying or pasting a chart sheet, changing a chart type, changing a chart data source, undoing or redoing inserting or pasting a chart, and loading a workbook that contains a chart.


## Example

This example displays a message box when a new chart is added to the workbook.


```
Private Sub Workbook_NewChart(ByVal Ch As Chart) 
 MsgBox ("A new chart of the following chart type was added: " &amp; Ch.ChartType) 
End Sub
```
