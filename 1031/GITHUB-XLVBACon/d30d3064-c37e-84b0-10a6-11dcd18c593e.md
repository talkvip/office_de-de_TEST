# ShapeRange.Regroup Method (Excel)

Regroups the group that the specified shape range belonged to previously. Returns the regrouped shapes as a single  **[Shape](8f01fcd1-b7d9-5216-2de5-40fb6648a403.md)** object.


## Syntax

 _Ausdruck_. **Regroup**

 _Ausdruck_ A variable that represents a **ShapeRange** object.


### Return Value

Shape


## Remarks

The  **Regroup** method only restores the group for the first previously grouped shape it finds in the specified **[ShapeRange](e1b8229c-73a0-4a77-5e00-4bcec9032260.md)** collection. Therefore, if the specified shape range contains shapes that previously belonged to different groups, only one of the groups will be restored.

Note that because a group of shapes is treated as a single shape, grouping and ungrouping shapes changes the number of items in the  **[Shapes](f9c6548c-d028-1b70-a11c-c4b45ff19177.md)** collection and changes the index numbers of items that come after the affected items in the collection.


## Example

This example regroups the shapes in the selection in the active window. If the shapes haven't been previously grouped and ungrouped, this example will fail.


```
ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange.Regroup
```
