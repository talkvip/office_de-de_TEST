However, if backward compatibility is not required, you should consider using the new functions from now on, because they more accurately describe their functionality.

### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|

| _Arg2_|Erforderlich|**Double**|Significance - the multiple to which you want to round.|

## Remarks

 For example, if you want to avoid using pennies in your prices and your product is priced at $4.42, use the formula `Ceiling(4.42,0.05)` to round prices up to the nearest nickel.


- If either argument is nonnumeric,  **Ceiling** generates an error.
    
- Regardless of the sign of number, a value is rounded up when adjusted away from zero. If number is an exact multiple of significance, no rounding occurs.
    
- If number and significance have different signs,  **Ceiling** generates an error.
