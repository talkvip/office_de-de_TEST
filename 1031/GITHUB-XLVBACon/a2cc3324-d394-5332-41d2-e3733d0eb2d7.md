If the shape doesn't already have a shadow, this example adds one to it. The shadow will be filled in and obscured by the shape, even if the shape has no fill.


```
Set myDocument = Worksheets(1) 
With myDocument.Shapes(3).Shadow 
 .Visible = True 
 .OffsetX = 5 
 .OffsetY = -3 
 .Obscured = msoTrue 
End With
```
