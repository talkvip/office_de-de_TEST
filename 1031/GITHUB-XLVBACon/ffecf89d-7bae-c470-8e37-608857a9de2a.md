# Names Object (Excel)

A collection of all the  **[Name](cfedb297-ac0d-dff0-99c7-6927cc5f31ed.md)** objects in the application or workbook.


## Remarks

 Each **Name** object represents a defined name for a range of cells. Names can be either built-in names  such as Database, Print_Area, and Auto_Open  or custom names.

The  _RefersTo_ argument must be specified in A1-style notation, including dollar signs ($) where appropriate. For example, if cell A10 is selected on Sheet1 and you define a name by using the _RefersTo_ argument "=sheet1!A1:B1", the new name actually refers to cells A10:B10 (because you specified a relative reference). To specify an absolute reference, use "=sheet1!$A$1:$B$1".


## Example

Use the  **[Names](26be56ec-ea12-1600-602a-eb338d4a5a8b.md)** property to return the **Names** collection. The following example creates a list of all the names in the active workbook, plus the addresses they refer to.


```
Set nms = ActiveWorkbook.Names
Set wks = Worksheets(1)
For r = 1 To nms.Count
    wks.Cells(r, 2).Value = nms(r).Name
    wks.Cells(r, 3).Value = nms(r).RefersToRange.Address
Next
```


## Example

Use the  **[Add](89a888bc-20b1-dd63-ede9-b3ba1d5ffab0.md)** method to create a name and add it to the collection.The following example creates a new name that refers to cells A1:C20 on the worksheet named "Sheet1."


```
Names.Add Name:="test", RefersTo:="=sheet1!$a$1:$c$20"
```


## Example

Use  **Names**( _index_ ), where _index_ is the name index number or defined name, to return a single **Name** object. The following example deletes the name "mySortRange" from the active workbook.


```
ActiveWorkbook.Names("mySortRange").Delete
```
