# PageSetup Object (Excel)

Represents the page setup description.


## Remarks

 The **PageSetup** object contains all page setup attributes (left margin, bottom margin, paper size, and so on) as properties.


## Example

Use the  **[PageSetup](50310e49-49d0-c8c6-ed23-0eacae6355b5.md)** property to return a **PageSetup** object. The following example sets the orientation to landscape mode and then prints the worksheet.


```
With Worksheets("Sheet1")
    .PageSetup.Orientation = xlLandscape
    .PrintOut
End With
```


## Example

The  **With** statement makes it easier and faster to set several properties at the same time. The following example sets all the margins for worksheet one.


```
With Worksheets(1).PageSetup
    .LeftMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.5)
    .RightMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.75)
    .TopMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(1.5)
    .BottomMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(1)
    .HeaderMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.5)
    .FooterMargin = Application.InchesToPoints(0.5)
End With
```
