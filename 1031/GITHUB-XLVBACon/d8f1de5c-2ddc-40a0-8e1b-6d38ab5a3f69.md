# WorksheetFunction.ChiSq_Test Method (Excel)

Returns the test for independence.


## Syntax

 _Ausdruck_. **ChiSq_Test**( ** _Arg1_**, ** _Arg2_** )

 _Ausdruck_ A variable that represents a **[WorksheetFunction](7b1d5639-363d-632c-2cf0-2232562646b6.md)** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Arg1_|Erforderlich|**Variant**|The range of data that contains observations to test against expected values.|
| _Arg2_|Erforderlich|**Variant**|The range of data that contains the ratio of the product of row totals and column totals to the grand total.|

### Return Value

Double


## Remarks

ChiSq_Test returns the value from the chi-squared (? 2 ) distribution for the statistic and the appropriate degrees of freedom. You can use ?2 tests to determine whether hypothesized results are verified by an experiment:


- If actual_range and expected_range have a different number of data points, ChiSq_Test returns the #N/A error value.
    
- The ?2 test first calculates a ?2 statistic using the formula:
![](images/awfchtst_ZA06051120.gif)where: A ij = actual frequency in the i-th row, j-th column Eij = expected frequency in the i-th row, j-th column r = number or rows c = number of columns
    
- A low value of ? 2 is an indicator of independence. As can be seen from the formula, ?2 is always positive or 0, and is 0 only if Aij = Eij for every i,j.
    
- ChiSq_Test returns the probability that a value of the ? 2 statistic at least as high as the value calculated by the above formula could have happened by chance under the assumption of independence. In computing this probability, ChiSq_Test uses the ?2 distribution with an appropriate number of degrees of freedom, df. If r > 1 and c > 1, then df = (r - 1)(c - 1). If r = 1 and c > 1, then df = c - 1 or if r > 1 and c = 1, then df = r - 1. r = c= 1 is not allowed and generates an error.
    
- Use of ChiSq_Test is most appropriate when E ij ?s are not too small. Some statisticians suggest that each Eij should be greater than or equal to 5.
