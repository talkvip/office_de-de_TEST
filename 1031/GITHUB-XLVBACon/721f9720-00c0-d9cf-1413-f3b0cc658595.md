# CubeField.AddMemberPropertyField Method (Excel)

Adds a member property field to the display for the cube field.


## Syntax

 _Ausdruck_. **AddMemberPropertyField**( ** _Property_**, ** _PropertyOrder_**, ** _PropertyDisplayedIn_** )

 _Ausdruck_ A variable that represents a **CubeField** object.


### Parameters



|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _Property_|Erforderlich|**String**|The unique name of the member property. For balanced hierarchies, a unique name can be created by appending the "quoted" member property name to the unique name of the level with which the member property is associated. For unbalanced hierarchies, a unique name can be created by appending the "quoted" member property name to the unique name of the hierarchy.|
| _PropertyOrder_|Optional|**Variant**|Sets the  **[PropertyOrder](b938d2bd-3e64-a861-c058-96daa81830bf.md)** property value for a **CubeField** object. The actual position in the collection will be immediately before the PivotTable field that currently has the same **PropertyOrder** value that is given in the argument. If no field has the given property order value, the range of acceptable values is 1 to the number of member properties already showing for the hierarchy plus one. This argument is one-based. If omitted, the property goes to the end of the list.|
| _PropertyDisplayedIn_|Optional|**[XlPropertyDisplayedIn](5df825f7-6aa4-7652-5405-33e4a0e2a0c2.md)**|Specifies where to display the property. If this argument is omitted, the member property field will be added to the PivotTable only.|

## Remarks

The property field specified will not be viewable if the PivotTable view has no fields.

To delete member properties, use the  **Delete** method to delete the **PivotField** object from the **PivotFields** collection.


## Example

In this example, Microsoft Excel adds a member property field titled "Description" to the PivotTable report view. This example assumes that a PivotTable exists on the active worksheet and that "Country", "Area", and "Description" are items in the report.


```
Sub UseAddMemberPropertyField() 
 
 Dim pvtTable As PivotTable 
 
 Set pvtTable = ActiveSheet.PivotTables(1) 
 
 With pvtTable 
 .ManualUpdate = True 
 .CubeFields("[Country]").LayoutForm = xlOutline 
 .CubeFields("[Country]").AddMemberPropertyField _ 
 Property:="[Country].[Area].[Description]" 
 .ManualUpdate = False 
 End With 
 
End Sub
```
