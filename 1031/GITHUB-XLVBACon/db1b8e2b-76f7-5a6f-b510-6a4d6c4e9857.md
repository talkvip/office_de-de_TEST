# ModelConnection Object (Excel)

Contain information for the new Model Connection Type introduced in Excel 2013 to interact with the integrated data model.


## Remarks

To use for all PivotTables connected to the model, there will have a new "special" workbook connection which always exists (and cannot be deleted) in workbooks which have a data model. It gets created when the model is first created in a workbook. All properties on this special workbook connection are read-only. Its name is: _Workbook Data Model_.
