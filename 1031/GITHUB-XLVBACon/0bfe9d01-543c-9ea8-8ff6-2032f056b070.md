# Application.FeatureInstall Property (Excel)

Returns or sets a value (constant) that specifies how Microsoft Excel handles calls to methods and properties that require features that aren't yet installed. Can be one of the  **[MsoFeatureInstall](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/25256738-d169-5c00-1d5d-eb8019811976%28Office.15%29.aspx)** constants listed in the following table. Read/write **MsoFeatureInstall**.


## Syntax

 _Ausdruck_. **FeatureInstall**

 _Ausdruck_ A variable that represents an **Application** object.


## Remarks


||
|:-----|
|**MsoFeatureInstall** can be one of these **MsoFeatureInstall** constants.|
|**msoFeatureInstallNone**. Generates a generic Automation error at run time when uninstalled features are called. This is the default constant.|
|**msoFeatureInstallOnDemand**. Prompts the user to install new features.|
|**msoFeatureInstallOnDemandWithUI**. Displays a progress meter during installation; doesn't prompt the user to install new features.|
You can use the  **msoFeatureInstallOnDemandWithUI** constant to prevent users from thinking that the application isn't responding while a feature is being installed. Use the **msoFeatureInstallNone** constant if you want the developer to be the only one who can install features.

If you have the  **[DisplayAlerts](d9f36a99-e9c9-9a67-abaf-9c8e49b4febc.md)** property set to **False**, users won't be prompted to install new features even if the **FeatureInstall** property is set to **msoFeatureInstallOnDemand**. If the **DisplayAlerts** property is set to **True**, an installation progress meter will appear if the **FeatureInstall** property is set to **msoFeatureInstallOnDemand**.


## Example

This example activates a new instance of Microsoft Word and checks the value of the  **FeatureInstall** property. Be sure to set a reference to the Microsoft Word object library. If the **FeatureInstall** property is set to **msoFeatureInstallNone**, the code displays a message box that asks the user whether they want to change the property setting. If the user responds Yes, the property is set to **msoFeatureInstallOnDemand**.


```
Dim WordApp As New Word.Application, Reply As Integer 
Application.ActivateMicrosoftApp xlMicrosoftWord With WordApp 
    If .FeatureInstall = msoFeatureInstallNone Then 
        Reply = MsgBox("Uninstalled features for this " _ 
            &amp; "application " &amp; vbCrLf _ 
            &amp; "may cause a run-time error when called." &amp; vbCrLf _ 
            &amp; vbCrLf _ 
            &amp; "Would you like to change this setting" &amp; vbCrLf _ 
            &amp; "to automatically install missing features?" _ 
            , 52, "Feature Install Setting") 
        If Reply = 6 Then 
            .FeatureInstall = msoFeatureInstallOnDemand 
        End If 
    End If 
End With
```
